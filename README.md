# sk-learn (scikit-learn) datasets data analytics

## Pre-requisites:
* Python v3.9 and above
* Jupyter or similar kernel (to interprete .ipynb python notebook)
* Visual Studio Code or similar IDE (to interact and modify the .ipynb python notebook code)

## Setting up the project:
1. Clone the repository using the following code  
```git clone https://github.com/PatelArpitt/sklearn-datasets-data-analytics.git```  
2. Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code, JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. For Visual Studio Code install the Jupyter extensions from Microsoft for Interactive Python Notebook (ipynb) language support.  
4. Run the cells from top to bottom to start the program.  
## This project has been created as an interactive tool for the data analytics of sk-learn datasets.

### In this project you will be able interact with an intuitive tool which is a step based module. It starts with the Step-1 of loading the dataset, where user is given an option of choosing a dataset between California Housing and Diabetes sk-learn datasets.
### If the user wants, you are also provided with a dropdown menu which lists all the sk-learn datasets which the user can use for the program.

1. Load the dataset.
2. Explore the data.
3. Split the data for training and testing.
4. Train the data model.
5. Test the data model.
6. Visualize the expected vs. predicted.
7. Create the regression model metrics.
8. Comparing the mean r2 scores of various models. (LinearRegression, ElasticNet, Lasso, and Ridge)
